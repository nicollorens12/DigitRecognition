## Information

As part of my jurney on learning more about Data Science and DL, I wanted to learn how NN work exactly and how to used them.

I read a lot, about how NN worked but the best resource I found was [3Blue1Brown NN Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruvnKk&list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi&ab_channel=3Blue1Brown).

After understanding how NN, Gradient Descent and backpropagation work, I tried to implement a simple NN class that could help me solve a handwritten digit recognition problem.
