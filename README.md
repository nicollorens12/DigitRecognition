As part of my jurney on learning more about Data Science and DL, I wanted to learn how NN work exactly and how to used them.

I read a lot, about how NN worked but the best resource I found was [3Blue1Brown NN Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruvnKk&list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi&ab_channel=3Blue1Brown).

After understanding how NN, Gradient Descent and backpropagation work, I tried to implement a simple NN class that could help me solve a handwritten digit recognition problem.

I used the [MNIST Handwritten Digits](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hojjatk/mnist-dataset) dataset.

Study.ipynb, is just now a way to understand the Dataset and create a first simple instance to see what's the overall performance.

## Future Improvements

- Improve API canvas/image processing as it produces poor results on diferent scenarios (Digit not centered, too big, too small, or not very "Handwritten")
- Add a Fine Tunning section to Study.ipynb as I think more improvements can be made to enhance performance of the model.
- Add a feedback option on the prediction to create more instances for the dataset so the model can be improved for digits written with a mouse/trackpadd.
